# QuantLib

A minimal repository of quantitative and machine learning tools written in C++ for learning purposes.

- Compile with `make`, run with `./main`, clean with `make clean`.
- Upon running `./main`, the user will be prompted to enter a ticker, a start-date, end-date and filename.
- Implement any computations / trade strategies into the `main.cpp` file which handles the extraction and removal of the .csv file.
